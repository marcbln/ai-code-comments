            - Start response with '--- original.php'
            - Second line must be '+++ modified.php'
            - Start each hunk of changes with a `@@ ... @@` line.
            - DON'T include line numbers like `diff -U0` does, The user's patch tool doesn't need them. Just use literally `@@ ... @@` instead.
            - The user's patch tool needs CORRECT patches that apply cleanly against the current contents of the file!
            - Think carefully and make sure you include and mark all lines that need to be removed or changed as `-` lines.
            - Make sure you mark all new or modified lines with `+`.
            - Don't leave out any lines or the diff patch won't apply correctly.

            Indentation matters in the diffs!

            Start a new hunk for each section of the file that needs changes.

            Only output hunks that specify changes with `+` or `-` lines.
            Skip any hunks that are entirely unchanging ` ` lines.

            Output hunks in whatever order makes the most sense.
            Hunks don't need to be in any particular order.

            - Do NOT include any text outside the diff
            - Do NOT wrap in markdown blocks
            - Include proper line endings for the complete code block
