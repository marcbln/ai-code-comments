### Implementation Plan: Add Explicit File Processing Message

This plan will modify the `add-comments` command to print a clear, informative message at the beginning of its execution, indicating exactly which file is being processed.

### Phase 1: Code Modification

The goal is to add a new log message that prints the absolute path of the file being processed as soon as the command starts.

1.  **File to Modify**: `aicoder/cli/commands/add_comments.py`
2.  **Locate the Function**: Open the file and find the `add_comments_command` function.
3.  **Identify Insertion Point**: The best place for the new message is immediately after the logger's verbosity is set, right after this line:
    ```python
    myLogger.set_verbose(verbose)
    ```
4.  **Action**: Add the following line at the identified insertion point:
    ```python
    myLogger.info(f"Processing file {file_path.resolve()}...")
    ```
5.  **Rationale**:
    *   This adds the exact output you requested.
    *   Using `file_path.resolve()` ensures that the full, absolute path to the file is always printed, which is unambiguous and helpful for tracking progress in scripts.
    *   Placing this at the beginning of the `try` block ensures it is the very first message the user sees for a given file, confirming that the process has started for that specific file.

### Phase 2: Verification

This phase ensures the change has been implemented correctly and produces the desired output.

1.  **Execute the Command**: Run the `add-comments` command on any PHP file. You can use a relative or absolute path.
    ```bash
    # Example execution
    aicoder add-comments --profile default some-php-file.php
    ```
2.  **Check the Output**:
    *   **Previous Output**: The output would begin with a message like `Sending request to LLM...` or `⏳ Analyzing...`.
    *   **Expected New Output**: The command's output should now start with the new, explicit message, followed by the other messages.
        ```
        Processing file /home/user/path/to/your/project/some-php-file.php...
        ⏳ Analyzing some-php-file.php: ...
        ...
        ```
3.  **Confirmation**: Verify that the first line of output is the new "Processing file..." message, containing the full path to the file. This will confirm the successful implementation of the plan.
